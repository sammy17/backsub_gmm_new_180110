@W [SIM-369] AXI_master port 'frame_in' has a depth of '76800'. Insufficient depth may result in simulation mismatch or freeze.
@W [SIM-369] AXI_master port 'frame_out' has a depth of '76800'. Insufficient depth may result in simulation mismatch or freeze.
@W [SIM-369] AXI_master port 'gmem_offset' has a depth of '614400'. Insufficient depth may result in simulation mismatch or freeze.
